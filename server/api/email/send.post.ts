 *
 * This is the file where the email sending process is done. We're now not on the front-end anymore but on the
 * back-end, which communicates with the server (in this case, Node.js), because only servers can send emails since
 * they're not client-side. This file also only accepts POST requests, which we have to keep in mind int the
 * front-end form.
 *
 * The process is very easy, as you can see below, and there are many alternative ways of doing this. But this is
 * the default method and, in my opinion, the easiest. We will do the following:
 *
 * 1. Import necessary packages
 * 2. Within the Nuxt handler function, we read what data was sent from the form
 * 3. We check if the data is valid (in this example, only if it exists)
 * 4. Declare two constants that will be the parameters the sending function will need.
 * 5. We (try to) send the email.
 * 6. We return the result so our front-end can see if it was successful or not.
